The system shall integrate with a version control system to store and manage source code.

2. Pipeline Triggering
The system shall automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline whenever new code is committed to the repository.

3. Build Automation
The system shall automatically build the application from the committed source code.

4. Automated Testing
The system shall execute automated tests (unit, integration, and regression tests) after a successful build.

5. Code Quality Analysis
The system shall perform code quality analysis using static code analysis tools.

6. Artifact Generation
The system shall generate deployable build artifacts such as binaries, packages, or container images.

7. Deployment to Staging
