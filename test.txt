# Requirements for CI/CD Pipeline System

## 1. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Code Version Control Integration

The system shall integrate with a version control system to store and manage source code.

### FR2: Pipeline Triggering

The system shall automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline whenever new code is committed to the repository.

### FR3: Build Automation

The system shall automatically build the application from the committed source code.

### FR4: Automated Testing

The system shall execute automated tests (unit, integration, and regression tests) after a successful build.

### FR5: Code Quality Analysis

The system shall perform static code analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues.

### FR6: Artifact Generation

The system shall generate deployable build artifacts such as binaries, packages, or container images.

### FR7: Deployment to Staging

The system shall deploy the application to a staging environment for validation and testing.

### FR8: Deployment to Production

The system shall deploy the application to the production environment after successful staging and approval.

### FR9: Monitoring and Logging

The system shall monitor deployments and maintain logs for build, test, and deployment activities.

### FR10: Notification System

The system shall notify developers and DevOps engineers about the status of builds, tests, and deployments.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

These define **how well the system should perform**.

### NFR1: Reliability

The system shall ensure consistent and repeatable builds and deployments.

### NFR2: Performance

The system shall complete build and test processes within acceptable time limits.

### NFR3: Scalability

The system shall support multiple projects and concurrent pipeline executions.

### NFR4: Security

The system shall restrict deployment access to authorized users only.

### NFR5: Availability

The system shall be available for use with minimal downtime.

### NFR6: Maintainability

The system shall be easy to update, extend, and maintain.

## 3. User Requirements

These describe requirements from the **user’s perspective**.

### UR1: Developer Requirements

* Developers should be able to commit code easily.
* Developers should receive quick feedback on build and test results.

### UR2: Tester Requirements

* Testers should be able to view test execution results.
* Testers should validate software quality before production release.

### UR3: DevOps Engineer Requirements

* DevOps engineers should manage deployment workflows.
* DevOps engineers should monitor application health post-deployment.

---

## 4. System Constraints

### SC1: Tool Constraint

The system shall use standard CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

### SC2: Platform Constraint

The system shall run on commonly used operating systems or cloud platforms.

## Short Exam-Friendly Summary

> The CI/CD pipeline system must automate code integration, testing, deployment, monitoring, and notification processes while ensuring reliability, security, and scalability. It supports developers, testers, and DevOps engineers by providing continuous feedback and controlled deployments.

If you want, I can:

* Map **each requirement to a specific use case**
* Reduce this to **exactly one page**
* Rewrite it in **very simple student language**

Just tell me how strict your evaluator is.
