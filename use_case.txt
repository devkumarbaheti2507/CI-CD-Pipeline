Description:
Compiles the source code and generates build artifacts (binaries, packages, containers) required for deployment.


5. Run Automated Tests

Continuously monitors each stage of the pipeline (build, test, deploy) to track success or failure.

9. Detect Failure

Actor: CI/CD System
Description:
Identifies failures occurring during build, testing, or deployment stages based on logs and error codes.



10. Analyze Failure

Actor: Automation Recovery Engine
Description:
Analyzes the root cause of the detected failure using logs, metrics, and predefined rules.


11. Retry Failed Stage

Actor: Automation Recovery Engine
Description:
Automatically retries the failed pipeline stage (e.g., build or test) when the failure is temporary or recoverable.

12. Rollback Deployment

Actor: Automation Recovery Engine
Description:
Reverts the system to the previously stable application version if deployment fails or causes system instability.



13. Restore Previous Stable Version

Actor: Automation Recovery Engine
Description:
Restores the last known working version of the application to ensure service continuity.



 14. Log Failure Details

Actor: CI/CD System
Description:
Stores detailed failure information, logs, and timestamps for debugging and auditing purposes.

17. Configure Recovery Rules

Actor: Admin / DevOps Engineer
Description:
Defines automated recovery actions such as retry limits, rollback conditions, and alert mechanisms.


18. View Pipeline Status

Actor: Developer / Admin
Description:
Displays real-time status of the pipeline, including success, failure, and recovery actions.

 19. View Reports and Logs
